                <p>
                    <b>Angry Apes United is a unique NFT collection of 8,888 Angry Apes generated from over 170+ hand drawn traits. The team and artists have worked on this project for over 2 months now, focusing on the development and quality of art.</b>
                    <br />
                    <br />Our goal is to stand out from all other projects and focus on the quality and beauty of art. Some traits will be common, rare, super rare, and ultra rare. Meaning they will appear from a variety of times, to several times, to only once. All Angry Apes are custom generated and will be launching on the Ethereum Blockchain.<br />
                    <br />Minting will take place on November 10th. Pre sale begins November 8th. On launch day youâ€™ll be able to mint an Angry Ape at the price of 0.075 ETH. This can change depending on the price of ETH during launch.
